### voice-enabled-app
##project is a Voice-Enabled Map Application. It’s designed for geospatial navigation with voice commands. It uses Leaflet.js for mapping, TensorFlow.js for speech recognition and OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather updates. You can interact with the map hands-free by giving commands like “navigate” and “weather”. When it recognises these commands, it will do specific tasks like navigating to a destination, showing place information, showing traffic updates and current weather information.
The application starts with a map centered on a default location and you can give voice commands using the TensorFlow.js speech recognizer. For navigation, it fetches the geographical coordinates and sets the map view accordingly. For weather updates, it uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather data based on the map’s centre coordinates. It’s designed to be a seamless and intuitive experience, especially for users with accessibility needs or where hands-free is preferred##
